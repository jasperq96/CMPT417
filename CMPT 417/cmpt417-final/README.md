# Comparison Between Heuristics and Simulations for Othello

Our program is a player vs. ai application, where the player is represented by Unbalanced's Othello's A.I., which can be found here:

To run our program:
1. run main.py and input the heuristic you want to use, as well as the depth you want minimax to run at.
2. open Unbalanced Othello and select a level (we recommend 10-15)
3. every move made from the A.I. in the python application is correlated to a move in the Unbalanced Othello's board. You will have to manually click that tile.
4. every move that the Unbalanced A.I. makes, you will have to manually type the coordinates into the python application. The coordinates are by rows, then columns.
5. if any player skips a turn, it will be reflected in our program.
6. at the end, the match statistics for the algorithm chosen will be displayed.
